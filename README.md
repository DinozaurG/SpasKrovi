# SpasKrovi
Everyone has situations involving a danger that threatens your own life: a fire, or a robbery, or a sharp pain in your knee. The list can go on for a long time. And it is not always possible to quickly call for help, and in the case of criminal actions directed against you, you also need to conceal the call.
# So, we introduce to you our app!
The app is your "panic button". You can use it to call emergency services (fire protection, police, ambulance) by voice command, or by a combination of buttons, or simply by going into the app and clicking the appropriate button. The selected service will receive your data and your location, and will come to you immediately!
